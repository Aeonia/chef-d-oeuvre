Hello everyone
I'm now going to show you my project "culture". 
This website was based on the num√©ric needs of little cultural structure. Whether it's a museum or an association aiming at organizing cultural events.
THe design was inspired by the user interface of some of the most famous museum. It simple so that the webmaster can use it quite easily but enough delicat so that it emphasize the structure activity. This site offers a blog and a user account to book events hostsed by the structure.
An admin account make it easy to add edit or remove an article or an event
